# Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Data Structures / Topics:** Array, Two Pointers, Binary Search

## Problem

You are given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order.

Find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers index1 and index2 as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

 
Example 1:


Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].


Example 2:


Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].


Example 3:


Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].


 
Constraints:


	2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
	-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
	numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
	-1000 <= target <= 1000
	The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

Provide your answer in exactly this structure:
1. Optimal Solution (code block, cpp)
2. Any alternative/brute-force approaches worth mentioning (code block, brief)
3. Reasoning — why this approach, what makes it correct, what's the complexity
4. Core Data Structure / Algorithm — name it explicitly and explain why it fits this problem
